### WhatsApp Message Extraction and Storage System

***

## ToDos
1. WhatsApp API Integration for Message Retrieval:
Select a suitable WhatsApp API or library for programmatic access to message content.
Implement functionality to retrieve messages, including sender, receiver, timestamp, and message content.
2. PostgreSQL Database Setup for Messages:
Set up a PostgreSQL database to store WhatsApp messages.
Define an appropriate schema to represent the message-related data (e.g., sender, receiver, content, timestamp).
3. Cloud Storage Configuration (AWS S3/GCS/Google Drive):
Choose a cloud storage service (AWS S3, GCS, or Google Drive) for storing images/videos.
Configure access permissions and obtain necessary credentials/API keys.
4. Integration for Image/Video Retrieval:
Extend the WhatsApp integration to handle media (images/videos) retrieval.
Implement logic to extract and download images and videos from WhatsApp.
5. Python Script for Database Insertion:
Develop a Python script that establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
Create functions/methods to insert message data into the appropriate database tables.
6. Cloud Storage SDK Integration:
Use the respective SDKs (e.g., boto3 for AWS S3, google-cloud-storage for GCS, or Google Drive API) to upload images/videos to the chosen cloud storage service.
Implement functions to upload downloaded media files to the configured storage.
7. Data Transformation and Insertion:
Process the retrieved messages, images, and videos and transform them into formats suitable for storage.
Insert message data into the PostgreSQL database and upload media files to the chosen cloud storage service.
8. Error Handling and Logging:
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions during message retrieval, database insertion, and cloud storage uploads.
Incorporate logging to track system activities and any encountered issues.
9. Testing and Validation:
Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure successful message retrieval, database insertion, and cloud storage uploads.
Validate stored data in the PostgreSQL database and confirm the presence of media files in the chosen cloud storage service.
10. Documentation:
Create detailed documentation explaining the system architecture, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
Include information on integration methods, libraries used, and handling of media files.
Additional Considerations:
11. Data Security:
Ensure secure handling of credentials and encryption for both the database and cloud storage service.
12. Performance Optimization:
Optimize code and configurations for efficient handling of messages, images, and videos.
13. Scalability and Maintainability:
Design the system for scalability and easy maintenance.
